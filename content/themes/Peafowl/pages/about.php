    	<h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>This is an example page for your chevereto site. You can edit this file located in <code>/content/themes/Peafowl/pages/about.php</code></p>
        
        <h2>How to setup/delete more pages?</h2>
        <p>Edit the <code>pages_config.php</code> file located on the same directory mentioned above. This file is the one that setups the pages, just read the notes and follow the comments on it.</p>
        
        <h2>How to change the visual style?</h2>
        <p>Just edit/add your CSS rules on <code>style.css</code> and write the HTML on each page.</p>
        
        <h2>What about JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>Easy as you may guess... Just open <code>header.php</code> and paste your scripts beetwen the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code> tag. Some scripts need to be in the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag, just use whatever fits your needs. By the way, you don't need to include jQuery because it loads by default on Chevereto.</p>
